# Hi, I'm Gareth

I'm a recent graduate from Ontario Tech University's Game Development & Entrepreneurship program. While I'm a big fan of all things game dev, my greatest skills relate to the game programming side of the field; I've been programming since early high school, and my passion for it only continues to grow. Throughout my university education, I have gotten the chance to work on many different game development projects, and I have had the opportunity to see and partake in full projects from start to finish. Through this education, I have learned many of the ins and outs of video game development, and I have gotten to apply my passion in programming to these projects while improving my interpersonal and teamwork skills. I'm excited to take what I have learned and apply it in the professional field of game development, and I am even more excited to continue to learn much more from doing so.
