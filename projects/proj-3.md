title: 'Broot Force'
---
Broot Force is a mobile game which incorporates tower defense and resource collection/incremental upgrade components. The player takes control of an alien tree which has begun to sprout on planet Earth, and their goal is to siphon the Earth of all its resources by reaching the center of the planet with the tree's roots. Meanwhile, the player must also defend their tree from the humans who are trying to cut it down. 

This project started as a result of the 48 hour Global Game Jam, and our team enjoyed the premise so much that we decided to continue developing the concept further.
